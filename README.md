# razer-naga-hex-h2-colors
a script to add colors to your razer naga hex v2, in case you are using razergenie and having issues where it resets back to spectrum. Also the mouse and/or keyboard lights turning off on screensaver/lock was annoying, so I had that disabled too. that can be done with this script and editing the config file
